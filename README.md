# NyaDS

This is team 9072's successor to our Nyahiito Control Panel: Nyahiito Driver Station.

## About
NyaDS can connect to a robot's IP and control the mode of it. Soon, you'll be able to connect controllers with it. NyaDS also has an autonomous system using the NyaDS class on the robot for setting up the autonomous' WebSocket server.

## Library
Get `boost` installed to use the header-only library: just include `ws.h` and go ahead...good luck...
